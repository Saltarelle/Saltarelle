Fixed compiling instance methods on serializable types.
Insert parentheses around number when a member is being accessed (eg. (1).member).
Removed implicit conversion of char to string because that caused issues with csc. Added error message when char is boxed because this is very unlikely to yield undesired behaviour.
Serializable types no longer have to be sealed (but they still cannot use virtual/override)
Fixed issue with Visual Studio IntelliSense
Fixed issue that causes s.IndexOf("x", 1) to be compiled to s.indexOf(String.fromCharCode('/'), 1)
Fixed issue using static members through subclasses of the declaring type.
Added new assembly-level ScriptSharpCompatibiliyAttribute.
Added equality and inequality operators to System.DateTime.
Some fixes to System.String

1.1.4
Fixed NuGet dependency versions. Installing Runtime will now always install the latest version of the compiler and so on.

1.1.3
Fixed issue cloning generic delegates (eg. Func, Action).

1.1.2
Fixed issue causing incorrect code to be generated when duplicate using directives were specified. Also added code to ensure an internal error is raised under similar circumstances.
RegexMatch has a Length property and is convertible to string[]
DateTime.ParseExact and ParseExactUtc metadata updated to return DateTime? (which they always actually have in script)

1.1.1
Added type NotSupportedException (required for the iterator blocks feature).

1.1.0
Use !! for dynamic conversions to bool.
Fixed internal error when implementing properties/events that are [NonScriptable]
Implemented support for iterator blocks (yield)
Minification improvements
DateTime is now an immutable struct, MutableDateTime is a mutable date class.

1.0.1
Fixed project URL and included history in NuGet packages.

1.0.0
Initial version
