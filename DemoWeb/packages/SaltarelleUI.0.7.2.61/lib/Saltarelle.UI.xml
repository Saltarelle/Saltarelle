        <member name="T:Saltarelle.UI.ITreeNode">
            <summary>
            Represents a tree node. Instances of this class are manipulated using static methods on the <see cref="T:Saltarelle.UI.Tree"/> class.
            Instances are created by the <see cref="M:Saltarelle.UI.Tree.CreateTreeNode"/> method.
            The reasons for this interface are:
            1) Script# does not support methods on [Record] types, and
            2) If we make the TreeNode class (whose members we don't want others to modify) public and its fields internal, Script# will minimize the field names, which is bad for JSON. [PreserveName] does not seem to work.

            <summary>
            Determines is a node is a child of another. Returns false if the nodes are the same.
