                  Access all matched DOM elements. This serves as a backwards-compatible
                  way of accessing all matched elements (other than the jQuery object
                  itself, which is, in fact, an array of elements).
            
                  It is useful if you need to operate on the DOM elements themselves instead of using built-in jQuery functions.

                  This allows you to extract the actual DOM element and operate on it
                  directly without necessarily using jQuery functionality on it.

                  This means that every time the passed-in function is executed
                  (which is once for every element matched) the 'this' keyword
                  points to the specific DOM element.
            
                  Additionally, the function, when executed, is passed a single
                  argument representing the position of the element in the matched

                  Wrap all matched elements with a structure of other elements.
                  This wrapping process is most useful for injecting additional
                  stucture into a document, without ruining the original semantic
                  qualities of a document.
            
                  This works by going through the first element
                  provided (which is generated, on the fly, from the provided HTML)
                  and finds the deepest ancestor element within its
                  structure - it is that element that will en-wrap everything else.
            
                  This does not work with elements that contain text. Any necessary text
                  must be added after the wrapping is done.

                  Bind a function to be executed whenever the DOM is ready to be
                  traversed and manipulated. This is probably the most important
                  function included in the event module, as it can greatly improve
                  the response times of your web applications.
            
                  In a nutshell, this is a solid replacement for using window.onload,
                  and attaching a function to that. By using this method, your bound function
                  will be called the instant the DOM is ready to be read and manipulated,
                  which is when what 99.99% of all JavaScript code needs to run.
            
                  There is one argument passed to the ready event handler: A reference to
                  the jQuery function. You can name that argument whatever you like, and
                  can therefore stick with the $ alias without risk of naming collisions.
            
                  Please ensure you have no code in your &lt;body&gt; onload event handler,
                  otherwise $(document).ready() may not fire.
            
                  You can have as many $(document).ready events on your page as you like.
                  The functions are then executed in the order they were added.

                  A function for making your own, custom animations. The key aspect of
                  this function is the object of style properties that will be animated,
                  and to what end. Each key within the object represents a style property
                  that will also be animated (for example: "height", "top", or "opacity").
            
                  Note that properties should be specified using camel case
                  eg. marginLeft instead of margin-left.
            
                  The value associated with the key represents to what end the property
                  will be animated. If a number is provided as the value, then the style
                  property will be transitioned from its current state to that new number.
                  Otherwise if the string "hide", "show", or "toggle" is provided, a default
                  animation will be constructed for that property.
