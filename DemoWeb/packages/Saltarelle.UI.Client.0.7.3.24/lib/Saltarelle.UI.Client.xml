            <summary>
            Removes a node from the tree, which must be attached. Does not fix the node's parent's child list. Returns the removed element, or null if there was no physical node (eg. if the node has never been expanded to).

            <summary>
            This method will hide then immediately restore all SELECT elements that are children of a specific element, if the browser is IE7. The reason is to fix a strange IE7 bug which causes SELECTs to sometimes be non-interactable.
